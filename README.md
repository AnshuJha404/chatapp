# chatapp

This is a chat application which is built using java programming with the help of VSstudio code IDE.
I have created gui for Client side using java Swing toolkit.
Here I have used socket programming (Java Socket programming is used for communication between the applications running on different JRE.
Java Socket programming can be connection-oriented or connection-less.) for connecting server and client.
In this application we can send messages from one user to another user.
